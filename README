"In a distant, war-torn land, there are 10 castles. There are two warlords: you and your archenemy. Each castle has its own strategic 
value for a would-be conqueror. Specifically, the castles are worth 1, 2, 3, …, 9, and 10 victory points. You and your enemy each have
100 soldiers to distribute, any way you like, to fight at any of the 10 castles. Whoever sends more soldiers to a given castle conquers 
that castle and wins its victory points. If you each send the same number of troops, you split the points. You don’t know what distribution of forces your enemy has chosen until the battles begin. Whoever wins the most points wins the war."


This problem was solved from a Riddler Classic: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-rule-riddler-nation/

Program.cs  is the bulk of the program: every possible combination is considered and the one with the most wins is selected.
Castle.cs   creates Castle objects in a database.
